	<h1>My First Article</h1>
	<p class="indented">Hey guys! This is my first time trying out blogging! Looking back, I've had months of preparation for this first article. After all that preparation I still didn't expect it to turn out like this! I hope you guys enjoy!</p>
	<p>Today was a really great day! It was the first time that any of us Lims have every gone rafting! The river was practically ready for us and we all went into the big raft! Of course we all got wet at least a little bit and the paddling was quite fun!</p>
	<p>Not sure how many articles I will post in this blog! For every article that I write I plan to make them quite long, and in this form </p>

	<h1>Not the Best Day</h1>
	<p class="indented">Read on to see the big lesson which you need to get before it's too late!</p>
	<p>Today was not the best day! I woke up and decided, meh let me just be free from this whole schedule stuff and I decided to just do what I want. Did not go the way I was expecting and I felt utterly and completely useless throughout the day. I hope that the rest of the day can go a little bit better!</p>
	<p>Lesson learned! Next time always make yourself a schedule and stick to it, that way you will end up being useful and doing many things through the day!</p>
